> The rapid evolution of modern malware presents significant challenges to the development of effective defense mechanisms. Traditional cyber deception techniques often rely on static or manually configured parameters, limiting their adaptability to dynamic and sophisticated threats. This study leverages Generative AI (GenAI) models to automate the creation of adaptive cyber deception ploys, focusing on structured prompt engineering (PE) to enhance relevance, actionability, and deployability. We introduce a systematic framework (SPADE) to address inherent challenges large language models (LLMs) pose to adaptive deceptions, including generalized outputs, ambiguity, under-utilization of contextual information, and scalability constraints. Evaluations across diverse malware scenarios using metrics such as Recall, Exact Match (EM), BLEU Score, and expert quality assessments identified ChatGPT-4o as the top performer. Additionally, it achieved high engagement (93%) and accuracy (96%) with minimal refinements. Gemini and ChatGPT-4o Mini demonstrated competitive performance, with Llama3.2 showing promise despite requiring further optimization. These findings highlight the transformative potential of GenAI in automating scalable, adaptive deception strategies and underscore the critical role of structured PE in advancing real-world cybersecurity applications.

> In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks, there is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt to evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine learning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity. Unfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning approaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to detect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic because it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as newly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in real-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network environments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental Learning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables continuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training gap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system activities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most valuable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the ADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in ransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such as Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a detection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate of 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.

- *Jimin Park, AHyun Ji, Minji Park, Mohammad Saidur Rahman, Se Eun Oh*

- `2501.01110v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01110v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01110v1)

> Continual Learning (CL) for malware classification tackles the rapidly evolving nature of malware threats and the frequent emergence of new types. Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.   In this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples. Additionally, we implement innovative selection schemes for replay samples based on the model's hidden representations.   Our comprehensive evaluation across Windows and Android malware datasets in a class-incremental learning scenario -- where new classes are introduced continuously over multiple tasks -- demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous methods. For example, our system achieves an average accuracy of 55% on Windows malware samples, significantly outperforming other GR-based models by 28%. This study provides practical insights for advancing GR-based malware classification systems. The implementation is available at \url {https://github.com/MalwareReplayGAN/MalCL}\footnote{The code will be made public upon the presentation of the paper}.

<summary>2025-01-06 16:29:32 - Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect npm Malicious Packages</summary>

- *Nusrat Zahan, Philipp Burckhardt, Mikola Lysenko, Feross Aboukhadijeh, Laurie Williams*

- `2403.12196v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12196v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12196v4)

> Existing malicious code detection techniques demand the integration of multiple tools to detect different malware patterns, often suffering from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to aid security analysts in detecting malicious packages by empirically studying the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting malicious code. We present SocketAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code. To evaluate the effectiveness of SocketAI, we leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We also compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SocketAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed. and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious activities detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy with 99% precision and 97% F1 scores, while GPT-3 offers a more cost-effective balance at 91% precision and 94% F1 scores. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, execution of arbitrary code, and suspicious domain categories as the top detected malicious packages.

- *Dipo Dunsin, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Karim Ouazzane, Vassil Vassilev*

- `2408.01999v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01999v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01999v2)

> This research focused on enhancing post-incident malware forensic investigation using reinforcement learning RL. We proposed an advanced MDP post incident malware forensics investigation model and framework to expedite post incident forensics. We then implement our RL Malware Investigation Model based on structured MDP within the proposed framework. To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.

- `2410.11463v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11463v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11463v2)

> The development of the DRL model for malware attribution involved extensive research, iterative coding, and numerous adjustments based on the insights gathered from predecessor models and contemporary research papers. This preparatory work was essential to establish a robust foundation for the model, ensuring it could adapt and respond effectively to the dynamic nature of malware threats. Initially, the model struggled with low accuracy levels, but through persistent adjustments to its architecture and learning algorithms, accuracy improved dramatically from about 7 percent to over 73 percent in early iterations. By the end of the training, the model consistently reached accuracy levels near 98 percent, demonstrating its strong capability to accurately recognise and attribute malware activities. This upward trajectory in training accuracy is graphically represented in the Figure, which vividly illustrates the model maturation and increasing proficiency over time.

- *Brandon J Walton, Mst Eshita Khatun, James M Ghawaly, Aisha Ali-Gombe*

- `2501.04848v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04848v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04848v1)

> Malware analysis is a complex process of examining and evaluating malicious software's functionality, origin, and potential impact. This arduous process typically involves dissecting the software to understand its components, infection vector, propagation mechanism, and payload. Over the years, deep reverse engineering of malware has become increasingly tedious, mainly due to modern malicious codebases' fast evolution and sophistication. Essentially, analysts are tasked with identifying the elusive needle in the haystack within the complexities of zero-day malware, all while under tight time constraints. Thus, in this paper, we explore leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic malware analysis to expedite the analysis of known and novel samples. Built on GPT-4o-mini model, \msp is designed to augment malware analysis for Android through a hierarchical-tiered summarization chain and strategic prompt engineering. Additionally, \msp performs malware categorization, distinguishing potential malware from benign applications, thereby saving time during the malware reverse engineering process. Despite not being fine-tuned for Android malware analysis, we demonstrate that through optimized and advanced prompt engineering \msp can achieve up to 77% classification accuracy while providing highly robust summaries at functional, class, and package levels. In addition, leveraging the backward tracing of the summaries from package to function levels allowed us to pinpoint the precise code snippets responsible for malicious behavior.

<summary>2025-01-09 17:21:00 - Integrating Explainable AI for Effective Malware Detection in Encrypted Network Traffic</summary>

- *Sileshi Nibret Zeleke, Amsalu Fentie Jember, Mario Bochicchio*

- `2501.05387v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05387v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05387v1)

> Encrypted network communication ensures confidentiality, integrity, and privacy between endpoints. However, attackers are increasingly exploiting encryption to conceal malicious behavior. Detecting unknown encrypted malicious traffic without decrypting the payloads remains a significant challenge. In this study, we investigate the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to detect malicious network traffic. We employ ensemble learning models to identify malicious activity using multi-view features extracted from various aspects of encrypted communication. To effectively represent malicious communication, we compiled a robust dataset with 1,127 unique connections, more than any other available open-source dataset, and spanning 54 malware families. Our models were benchmarked against the CTU-13 dataset, achieving performance of over 99% accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Additionally, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model demonstrated 99.32% accuracy, 99.53% precision, and 99.43% F1-score on our custom dataset. By leveraging Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we identified that the maximum packet size, mean inter-arrival time of packets, and transport layer security version used are the most critical features for the global model explanation. Furthermore, key features were identified as important for local explanations across both datasets for individual traffic samples. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the model decision-making process, enhancing the transparency and reliability of detecting malicious encrypted traffic.
