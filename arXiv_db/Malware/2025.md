> The rapid evolution of modern malware presents significant challenges to the development of effective defense mechanisms. Traditional cyber deception techniques often rely on static or manually configured parameters, limiting their adaptability to dynamic and sophisticated threats. This study leverages Generative AI (GenAI) models to automate the creation of adaptive cyber deception ploys, focusing on structured prompt engineering (PE) to enhance relevance, actionability, and deployability. We introduce a systematic framework (SPADE) to address inherent challenges large language models (LLMs) pose to adaptive deceptions, including generalized outputs, ambiguity, under-utilization of contextual information, and scalability constraints. Evaluations across diverse malware scenarios using metrics such as Recall, Exact Match (EM), BLEU Score, and expert quality assessments identified ChatGPT-4o as the top performer. Additionally, it achieved high engagement (93%) and accuracy (96%) with minimal refinements. Gemini and ChatGPT-4o Mini demonstrated competitive performance, with Llama3.2 showing promise despite requiring further optimization. These findings highlight the transformative potential of GenAI in automating scalable, adaptive deception strategies and underscore the critical role of structured PE in advancing real-world cybersecurity applications.

- `2501.01089v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01089v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01089v1)

> In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks, there is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt to evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine learning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity. Unfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning approaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to detect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic because it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as newly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in real-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network environments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental Learning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables continuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training gap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system activities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most valuable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the ADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in ransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such as Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a detection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate of 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.

- *Jimin Park, AHyun Ji, Minji Park, Mohammad Saidur Rahman, Se Eun Oh*

- `2501.01110v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01110v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01110v1)

> Continual Learning (CL) for malware classification tackles the rapidly evolving nature of malware threats and the frequent emergence of new types. Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.   In this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples. Additionally, we implement innovative selection schemes for replay samples based on the model's hidden representations.   Our comprehensive evaluation across Windows and Android malware datasets in a class-incremental learning scenario -- where new classes are introduced continuously over multiple tasks -- demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous methods. For example, our system achieves an average accuracy of 55% on Windows malware samples, significantly outperforming other GR-based models by 28%. This study provides practical insights for advancing GR-based malware classification systems. The implementation is available at \url {https://github.com/MalwareReplayGAN/MalCL}\footnote{The code will be made public upon the presentation of the paper}.

<summary>2025-01-06 16:29:32 - Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect npm Malicious Packages</summary>

- *Nusrat Zahan, Philipp Burckhardt, Mikola Lysenko, Feross Aboukhadijeh, Laurie Williams*

- `2403.12196v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12196v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12196v4)

> Existing malicious code detection techniques demand the integration of multiple tools to detect different malware patterns, often suffering from high misclassification rates. Therefore, malicious code detection techniques could be enhanced by adopting advanced, more automated approaches to achieve high accuracy and a low misclassification rate. The goal of this study is to aid security analysts in detecting malicious packages by empirically studying the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting malicious code. We present SocketAI, a malicious code review workflow to detect malicious code. To evaluate the effectiveness of SocketAI, we leverage a benchmark dataset of 5,115 npm packages, of which 2,180 packages have malicious code. We conducted a baseline comparison of GPT-3 and GPT-4 models with the state-of-the-art CodeQL static analysis tool, using 39 custom CodeQL rules developed in prior research to detect malicious Javascript code. We also compare the effectiveness of static analysis as a pre-screener with SocketAI workflow, measuring the number of files that need to be analyzed. and the associated costs. Additionally, we performed a qualitative study to understand the types of malicious activities detected or missed by our workflow. Our baseline comparison demonstrates a 16% and 9% improvement over static analysis in precision and F1 scores, respectively. GPT-4 achieves higher accuracy with 99% precision and 97% F1 scores, while GPT-3 offers a more cost-effective balance at 91% precision and 94% F1 scores. Pre-screening files with a static analyzer reduces the number of files requiring LLM analysis by 77.9% and decreases costs by 60.9% for GPT-3 and 76.1% for GPT-4. Our qualitative analysis identified data theft, execution of arbitrary code, and suspicious domain categories as the top detected malicious packages.

- *Dipo Dunsin, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem, Karim Ouazzane, Vassil Vassilev*

- `2408.01999v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01999v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01999v2)

> This research focused on enhancing post-incident malware forensic investigation using reinforcement learning RL. We proposed an advanced MDP post incident malware forensics investigation model and framework to expedite post incident forensics. We then implement our RL Malware Investigation Model based on structured MDP within the proposed framework. To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.

> The development of the DRL model for malware attribution involved extensive research, iterative coding, and numerous adjustments based on the insights gathered from predecessor models and contemporary research papers. This preparatory work was essential to establish a robust foundation for the model, ensuring it could adapt and respond effectively to the dynamic nature of malware threats. Initially, the model struggled with low accuracy levels, but through persistent adjustments to its architecture and learning algorithms, accuracy improved dramatically from about 7 percent to over 73 percent in early iterations. By the end of the training, the model consistently reached accuracy levels near 98 percent, demonstrating its strong capability to accurately recognise and attribute malware activities. This upward trajectory in training accuracy is graphically represented in the Figure, which vividly illustrates the model maturation and increasing proficiency over time.

- `2501.04848v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04848v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04848v1)

> Malware analysis is a complex process of examining and evaluating malicious software's functionality, origin, and potential impact. This arduous process typically involves dissecting the software to understand its components, infection vector, propagation mechanism, and payload. Over the years, deep reverse engineering of malware has become increasingly tedious, mainly due to modern malicious codebases' fast evolution and sophistication. Essentially, analysts are tasked with identifying the elusive needle in the haystack within the complexities of zero-day malware, all while under tight time constraints. Thus, in this paper, we explore leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic malware analysis to expedite the analysis of known and novel samples. Built on GPT-4o-mini model, \msp is designed to augment malware analysis for Android through a hierarchical-tiered summarization chain and strategic prompt engineering. Additionally, \msp performs malware categorization, distinguishing potential malware from benign applications, thereby saving time during the malware reverse engineering process. Despite not being fine-tuned for Android malware analysis, we demonstrate that through optimized and advanced prompt engineering \msp can achieve up to 77% classification accuracy while providing highly robust summaries at functional, class, and package levels. In addition, leveraging the backward tracing of the summaries from package to function levels allowed us to pinpoint the precise code snippets responsible for malicious behavior.

- `2501.05387v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05387v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05387v1)

> Encrypted network communication ensures confidentiality, integrity, and privacy between endpoints. However, attackers are increasingly exploiting encryption to conceal malicious behavior. Detecting unknown encrypted malicious traffic without decrypting the payloads remains a significant challenge. In this study, we investigate the integration of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to detect malicious network traffic. We employ ensemble learning models to identify malicious activity using multi-view features extracted from various aspects of encrypted communication. To effectively represent malicious communication, we compiled a robust dataset with 1,127 unique connections, more than any other available open-source dataset, and spanning 54 malware families. Our models were benchmarked against the CTU-13 dataset, achieving performance of over 99% accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Additionally, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model demonstrated 99.32% accuracy, 99.53% precision, and 99.43% F1-score on our custom dataset. By leveraging Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we identified that the maximum packet size, mean inter-arrival time of packets, and transport layer security version used are the most critical features for the global model explanation. Furthermore, key features were identified as important for local explanations across both datasets for individual traffic samples. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the model decision-making process, enhancing the transparency and reliability of detecting malicious encrypted traffic.

> The widespread usage of Microsoft Windows has unfortunately led to a surge in malware, posing a serious threat to the security and privacy of millions of users. In response, the research community has mobilized, with numerous efforts dedicated to strengthening defenses against these threats. The primary goal of these techniques is to detect malicious software early, preventing attacks before any damage occurs. However, many of these methods either claim that packing has minimal impact on malware detection or fail to address the reliability of their approaches when applied to packed samples. Consequently, they are not capable of assisting victims in handling packed programs or recovering from the damages caused by untimely malware detection. In light of these challenges, we propose VisUnpack, a static analysis-based data visualization framework for bolstering attack prevention while aiding recovery post-attack by unveiling malware patterns and offering more detailed information including both malware class and family. Our method includes unpacking packed malware programs, calculating local similarity descriptors based on basic blocks, enhancing correlations between descriptors, and refining them by minimizing noises to obtain self-analysis descriptors. Moreover, we employ machine learning to learn the correlations of self-analysis descriptors through architectural learning for final classification. Our comprehensive evaluation of VisUnpack based on a freshly gathered dataset with over 27,106 samples confirms its capability in accurately classifying malware programs with a precision of 99.7%. Additionally, VisUnpack reveals that most antivirus products in VirusTotal can not handle packed samples properly or provide precise malware classification information. We also achieve over 97% space savings compared to existing data visualization based methods.

The findings from this research highlight the effectiveness of the Random Forest model, achieving an accuracy of 90% for the Network Traffic Classifier and 96% for the Malware Analysis Dual Model application. Our research highlights the strengths of AI-powered cyber security. The Random Forest model excels at classifying cyber threats, offering an efficient and robust solution. Deep learning models significantly improve accuracy, and their resource demands can be managed using cloud-based TPUs and GPUs. Cloud environments themselves provide a perfect platform for hosting these AI/ML systems, while container technology ensures both efficiency and scalability.

> This Research proposes a Novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimise malware forensics investigation during cyber incident response. It aims to improve forensic investigation efficiency by reducing false negatives and adapting current practices to evolving malware signatures. The proposed RL framework leverages techniques such as Q-learning and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to train the system to identify malware patterns in live memory dumps, thereby automating forensic tasks. The RL model is based on a detailed malware workflow diagram that guides the analysis of malware artefacts using static and behavioural techniques as well as machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it seeks to address challenges in the UK justice system by ensuring the accuracy of forensic evidence. We conduct testing and evaluation in controlled environments, using datasets created with Windows operating systems to simulate malware infections. The experimental results demonstrate that RL improves malware detection rates compared to conventional methods, with the RL model's performance varying depending on the complexity and learning rate of the environment. The study concludes that while RL offers promising potential for automating malware forensics, its efficacy across diverse malware types requires ongoing refinement of reward systems and feature extraction methods.

> There is an expectation that users of home IoT devices will be able to secure those devices, but they may lack information about what they need to do. In February 2022, we launched a web service that scans users' IoT devices to determine how secure they are. The service aims to diagnose and remediate vulnerabilities and malware infections of IoT devices of Japanese users. This paper reports on findings from operating this service drawn from three studies: (1) the engagement of 114,747 users between February, 2022 - May, 2024; (2) a large-scale evaluation survey among service users (n=4,103), and; (3) an investigation and targeted survey (n=90) around the remediation actions of users of non-secure devices. During the operation, we notified 417 (0.36%) users that one or more of their devices were detected as vulnerable, and 171 (0.15%) users that one of their devices was infected with malware. The service found no issues for 99% of users. Still, 96% of all users evaluated the service positively, most often for it providing reassurance, being free of charge, and short diagnosis time. Of the 171 users with malware infections, 67 returned to the service later for a new check, with 59 showing improvement. Of the 417 users with vulnerable devices, 151 users revisited and re-diagnosed, where 75 showed improvement. We report on lessons learned, including a consideration of the capabilities that non-expert users will assume of a security scan.

> The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has transformed the healthcare industry by connecting medical devices in monitoring treatment outcomes of patients. This increased connectivity has resulted to significant security vulnerabilities in the case of malware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This literature review examines the vulnerabilities of IoMT devices, focusing on critical threats and exploring mitigation strategies. We conducted a comprehensive search across leading databases such as ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Elsevier to analyze peer-reviewed studies published within the last five years (from 2019 to 2024). The review shows that inadequate encryption protocols, weak authentication methods, and irregular firmware updates are the main causes of risks associated with IoMT devices. We have identified emerging solutions like machine learning algorithms, blockchain technology, and edge computing as promising approaches to enhance IoMT security. This review emphasizes the pressing need to develop lightweight security measures and standardized protocols to protect patient data and ensure the integrity of healthcare services.

> We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, allowing changes in one to be automatically reflected in the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.

> This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM applications across various domains, including hardware design security, intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling, data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.

> In Android apps, their developers frequently place app promotion ads, namely advertisements to promote other apps. Unfortunately, the inadequate vetting of ad content allows malicious developers to exploit app promotion ads as a new distribution channel for malware. To help detect malware distributed via app promotion ads, in this paper, we propose a novel approach, named ADGPE, that synergistically integrates app user interface (UI) exploration with graph learning to automatically collect app promotion ads, detect malware promoted by these ads, and explain the promotion mechanisms employed by the detected malware. Our evaluation on 18, 627 app promotion ads demonstrates the substantial risks in the app promotion ecosystem.

> The threat of malware is a serious concern for computer networks and systems, highlighting the need for accurate classification techniques. In this research, we experiment with multimodal machine learning approaches for malware classification, based on the structured nature of the Windows Portable Executable (PE) file format. Specifically, we train Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models on features extracted from PE headers, we train these same models on features extracted from the other sections of PE files, and train each model on features extracted from the entire PE file. We then train SVM models on each of the nine header-sections combinations of these baseline models, using the output layer probabilities of the component models as feature vectors. We compare the baseline cases to these multimodal combinations. In our experiments, we find that the best of the multimodal models outperforms the best of the baseline cases, indicating that it can be advantageous to train separate models on distinct parts of Windows PE files.

This research investigates the effectiveness of benign and malicious adversarial examples (AEs) in evasion and poisoning attacks on the Portable Executable file domain. A novel focus of this study is on benign AEs, which, although not directly harmful, can increase false positives and undermine trust in antivirus solutions. We propose modifying existing adversarial malware generators to produce benign AEs and show they are as successful as malware AEs in evasion attacks. Furthermore, our data show that benign AEs have a more decisive influence in poisoning attacks than standard malware AEs, demonstrating their superior ability to decrease the model's performance. Our findings introduce new opportunities for adversaries and further increase the attack surface that needs to be protected by security researchers.

> In this paper we compare traditional machine learning and deep learning models trained on a malware dataset when subjected to adversarial attack based on label-flipping. Specifically, we investigate the robustness of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), LightGBM, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), MobileNet, and DenseNet models when facing varying percentages of misleading labels. We empirically assess the the accuracy of each of these models under such an adversarial attack on the training data. This research aims to provide insights into which models are inherently more robust, in the sense of being better able to resist intentional disruptions to the training data. We find wide variation in the robustness of the models tested to adversarial attack, with our MLP model achieving the best combination of initial accuracy and robustness.

> With increasingly sophisticated cyber-adversaries able to access a wider repertoire of mechanisms to implant malware such as ransomware, CPU/GPU keyloggers, and stealthy kernel rootkits, there is an urgent need for techniques to detect and mitigate such attacks. While state of the art relies on digital and analog side channel measurements assuming trustworthiness of measurements obtained on the main processor, such an approach has limitations since processor-based side channel measurements are potentially untrustworthy. Sophisticated adversaries (especially in late stage cyber attacks when they have breached the computer and network security systems such as firewalls and antivirus and penetrated the computer's OS) can compromise user-space and kernel-space measurements. To address this key limitation of state of the art, we propose a "subcomponent-level" approach to collect side channel measurements so as to enable robust anomaly detection in a modern computer even when the main processor is compromised. Our proposed approach leverages the fact that modern computers are complex systems with multiple interacting subcomponents and measurements from subcomponents can be used to detect anomalies even when the main processor is no longer trustworthy. We develop mechanisms to obtain time series measurements of activity of several subcomponents and methodologies to process and fuse these measurements for anomaly detection. The subcomponents include network interface controller, GPU, CPU Hardware Performance Counters, CPU power, and keyboard. Our main hypothesis is that subcomponent measurements can enable detection of security threats without requiring a trustworthy main processor. By enabling real-time measurements from multiple subcomponents, the goal is to provide a deeper visibility into system operation, thereby yielding a powerful tool to track system operation and detect anomalies.

> Android malware presents a persistent threat to users' privacy and data integrity. To combat this, researchers have proposed machine learning-based (ML-based) Android malware detection (AMD) systems. However, adversarial Android malware attacks compromise the detection integrity of the ML-based AMD systems, raising significant concerns. Existing defenses against adversarial Android malware provide protections against feature space attacks which generate adversarial feature vectors only, leaving protection against realistic threats from problem space attacks which generate real adversarial malware an open problem. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing ADD, a practical adversarial Android malware defense framework designed as a plug-in to enhance the adversarial robustness of the ML-based AMD systems against problem space attacks. Our extensive evaluation across various ML-based AMD systems demonstrates that ADD is effective against state-of-the-art problem space adversarial Android malware attacks. Additionally, ADD shows the defense effectiveness in enhancing the adversarial robustness of real-world antivirus solutions.

> We present the first large-scale analysis of 339 cybercriminal activity channels (CACs). Followed by over 23.8 million users, these channels share a wide array of malicious and unethical content with their subscribers, including compromised credentials, pirated software and media, social media manipulation tools, and blackhat hacking resources such as malware, exploit kits, and social engineering scams. To evaluate these channels, we developed DarkGram, a BERT-based framework that automatically identifies malicious posts from the CACs with an accuracy of 96%. Using DarkGram, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 53,605 posts shared on these channels between February and May 2024, revealing key characteristics of the content. While much of this content is distributed for free, channel administrators frequently employ strategies such as promotions and giveaways to engage users and boost the sales of premium cybercriminal content. Interestingly, these channels sometimes pose significant risks to their own subscribers. Notably, 28.1% of the links shared in these channels contained phishing attacks, and 38% of executable files were bundled with malware. Analyzing how subscribers consume and positively react to the shared content paints a dangerous picture of the perpetuation of cybercriminal content at scale. We also found that the CACs can evade scrutiny or platform takedowns by quickly migrating to new channels with minimal subscriber loss, highlighting the resilience of this ecosystem. To counteract this, we utilized DarkGram to detect emerging channels and reported malicious content to Telegram and affected organizations. This resulted in the takedown of 196 channels over three months. Our findings underscore the urgent need for coordinated efforts to combat the growing threats posed by these channels. To aid this effort, we open-source our dataset and the DarkGram framework.

> As malware such as ransomware becomes sophisticated, the ability to find and neutralize it requires more robust and tamper-resistant solutions. Current methods rely on data from compromised hosts, lack hardware isolation, and cannot detect emerging threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SHIELD - a detection architecture leveraging FPGA-based open-source SATA and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity for software executing on a target device. SHIELD provides three distinct contributions: It (1) develops a framework to obtain and analyze multi-level hardware metrics at NBD, FPGA, and SATA storage levels, and shows their ability to differentiate between harmless and malicious software; (2) Broadens the functionality of an open-source FPGA-driven SATA Host Bus Adapter (HBA) to offer complete data storage capabilities through NBD without relying on the host system; (3) Provides a foundation for using the methodology and metrics in automated machine learning-assisted detection and ASIC integration for advanced mitigation capabilities in data storage devices. SHIELD analyzes 10 benign programs and 10 modern ransomware families to illustrate its capacity for real-time monitoring and use in distinguishing between ransomware and benign software. Experimental evidence shows SHIELD's robust host-independent and hardware-assisted metrics are a basis for detection, allowing to observe program execution and detect malicious activities at the storage level.

> Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

> Determining the family to which a malicious file belongs is an essential component of cyberattack investigation, attribution, and remediation. Performing this task manually is time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Automated tools using that label malware using antivirus detections lack accuracy and/or scalability, making them insufficient for real-world applications. Three pervasive shortcomings in these tools are responsible: (1) incorrect parsing of antivirus detections, (2) errors during family alias resolution, and (3) an inappropriate antivirus aggregation strategy. To address each of these, we created our own malware family labeling tool called ClarAVy. ClarAVy utilizes a Variational Bayesian approach to aggregate detections from a collection of antivirus products into accurate family labels. Our tool scales to enormous malware datasets, and we evaluated it by labeling $\approx$40 million malicious files. ClarAVy has 8 and 12 percentage points higher accuracy than the prior leading tool in labeling the MOTIF and MalPedia datasets, respectively.

> Information hiding is the process of embedding data within another form of data, often to conceal its existence or prevent unauthorized access. This process is commonly used in various forms of secure communications (steganography) that can be used by bad actors to propagate malware, exfiltrate victim data, and discreetly communicate. Recent work has utilized deep neural networks to remove this hidden information in a defense mechanism known as sanitization. Previous deep learning works, however, are unable to scale efficiently beyond the MNIST dataset. In this work, we present a novel sanitization method called DM-SUDS that utilizes a diffusion model framework to sanitize/remove hidden information from image-into-image universal and dependent steganography from CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We evaluate DM-SUDS against three different baselines using MSE, PSNR, SSIM, and NCC metrics and provide further detailed analysis through an ablation study. DM-SUDS outperforms all three baselines and significantly improves image preservation MSE by 50.44%, PSNR by 12.69%, SSIM by 11.49%, and NCC by 3.26% compared to previous deep learning approaches. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation specification that considers the successful removal of hidden information (safety) as well as the resulting quality of the sanitized image (utility). We further demonstrate the versatility of this method with an application in an audio case study, demonstrating its broad applicability to additional domains.

> Backdoor Malware are installed by an attacker on the victim's server(s) for authorized access. A customized backdoor is weaponized to execute unauthorized system, database and application commands to access the user credentials and confidential digital assets. Recently, we discovered and analyzed a targeted persistent module backdoor in Web Server in an online business company that was undetectable by their deployed Anti-Virus software for a year. This led us to carry out research to detect this specific type of persistent module backdoor installed in Web servers. Other than typical Malware static analysis, we carry out analysis with binary similarity, strings, and command obfuscation over the backdoor, resulting in the Target Attack Backdoor Malware Analysis Matrix (TABMAX) for organizations to detect this sophisticated target attack backdoor instead of a general one which can be detected by Anti-Virus detectors. Our findings show that backdoor malware can be designed with different APIs, commands, strings, and query language on top of preferred libraries used by typical Malware.

> We present an approach to identifying which ransomware adversaries are most likely to target specific entities, thereby assisting these entities in formulating better protection strategies. Ransomware poses a formidable cybersecurity threat characterized by profit-driven motives, a complex underlying economy supporting criminal syndicates, and the overt nature of its attacks. This type of malware has consistently ranked among the most prevalent, with a rapid escalation in activity observed. Recent estimates indicate that approximately two-thirds of organizations experienced ransomware attacks in 2023 \cite{Sophos2023Ransomware}. A central tactic in ransomware campaigns is publicizing attacks to coerce victims into paying ransoms. Our study utilizes public disclosures from ransomware victims to predict the likelihood of an entity being targeted by a specific ransomware variant. We employ a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that uses a unique chain-of-thought, multi-shot prompt methodology to define adversary SKRAM (Skills, Knowledge, Resources, Authorities, and Motivation) profiles from ransomware bulletins, threat reports, and news items. This analysis is enriched with publicly available victim data and is further enhanced by a heuristic for generating synthetic data that reflects victim profiles. Our work culminates in the development of a machine learning model that assists organizations in prioritizing ransomware threats and formulating defenses based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the most likely attackers.

> Machine learning (ML) has rapidly advanced in recent years, revolutionizing fields such as finance, medicine, and cybersecurity. In malware detection, ML-based approaches have demonstrated high accuracy; however, their lack of transparency poses a significant challenge. Traditional black-box models often fail to provide interpretable justifications for their predictions, limiting their adoption in security-critical environments where understanding the reasoning behind a detection is essential for threat mitigation and response. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this gap by enhancing model interpretability while maintaining strong detection capabilities. This survey presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques for malware analysis, with a specific focus on explainability methods. We examine existing XAI frameworks, their application in malware classification and detection, and the challenges associated with making malware detection models more interpretable. Additionally, we explore recent advancements and highlight open research challenges in the field of explainable malware analysis. By providing a structured overview of XAI-driven malware detection approaches, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to bridge the gap between ML performance and explainability in cybersecurity.

> Learning-based Android malware detectors degrade over time due to natural distribution drift caused by malware variants and new families. This paper systematically investigates the challenges classifiers trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) face against such distribution shifts and attributes their shortcomings to their inability to learn stable discriminative features. Invariant learning theory offers a promising solution by encouraging models to generate stable representations crossing environments that expose the instability of the training set. However, the lack of prior environment labels, the diversity of drift factors, and low-quality representations caused by diverse families make this task challenging. To address these issues, we propose TIF, the first temporal invariant training framework for malware detection, which aims to enhance the ability of detectors to learn stable representations across time. TIF organizes environments based on application observation dates to reveal temporal drift, integrating specialized multi-proxy contrastive learning and invariant gradient alignment to generate and align environments with high-quality, stable representations. TIF can be seamlessly integrated into any learning-based detector. Experiments on a decade-long dataset show that TIF excels, particularly in early deployment stages, addressing real-world needs and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

> Encrypted behavioral patterns provide a unique avenue for classifying complex digital threats without reliance on explicit feature extraction, enabling detection frameworks to remain effective even when conventional static and behavioral methodologies fail. A novel approach based on Neural Encrypted State Transduction (NEST) is introduced to analyze cryptographic flow residuals and classify threats through their encrypted state transitions, mitigating evasion tactics employed through polymorphic and obfuscated attack strategies. The mathematical formulation of NEST leverages transduction principles to map state transitions dynamically, enabling high-confidence classification without requiring direct access to decrypted execution traces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved detection accuracy across multiple ransomware families while exhibiting resilience against adversarial perturbations and previously unseen attack variants. The model maintains competitive processing efficiency, offering a practical balance between classification performance and computational resource constraints, making it suitable for large-scale security deployments. Comparative assessments reveal that NEST consistently outperforms baseline classification models, particularly in detecting ransomware samples employing delayed encryption, entropy-based obfuscation, and memory-resident execution techniques. The capacity to generalize across diverse execution environments reinforces the applicability of encrypted transduction methodologies in adversarial classification tasks beyond conventional malware detection pipelines. The integration of residual learning mechanisms within the transduction layers further enhances classification robustness, minimizing both false positives and misclassification rates across varied operational contexts.

> Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are among the most sophisticated threats facing critical organizations worldwide. APTs employ specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) which make them difficult to detect in comparison to frequent and aggressive attacks. In fact, current network intrusion detection systems struggle to detect APTs communications, allowing such threats to persist unnoticed on victims' machines for months or even years. In this paper, we present EarlyCrow, an approach to detect APT malware command and control over HTTP(S) using contextual summaries.   The design of EarlyCrow is informed by a novel threat model focused on TTPs present in traffic generated by tools recently used as part of APT campaigns. The threat model highlights the importance of the context around the malicious connections, and suggests traffic attributes which help APT detection. EarlyCrow defines a novel multipurpose network flow format called PairFlow, which is leveraged to build the contextual summary of a PCAP capture, representing key behavioral, statistical and protocol information relevant to APT TTPs. We evaluate the effectiveness of EarlyCrow on unseen APTs obtaining a headline macro average F1-score of 93.02% with FPR of $0.74%.

> Millions of new pieces of malicious software (i.e., malware) are introduced each year. This poses significant challenges for antivirus vendors, who use machine learning to detect and analyze malware, and must keep up with changes in the distribution while retaining knowledge of older variants. Continual learning (CL) holds the potential to address this challenge by reducing the storage and computational costs of regularly retraining over all the collected data. Prior work, however, shows that CL techniques, which are designed primarily for computer vision tasks, fare poorly when applied to malware classification. To address these issues, we begin with an exploratory analysis of a typical malware dataset, which reveals that malware families are diverse and difficult to characterize, requiring a wide variety of samples to learn a robust representation. Based on these findings, we propose $\underline{M}$alware $\underline{A}$nalysis with $\underline{D}$iversity-$\underline{A}$ware $\underline{R}$eplay (MADAR), a CL framework that accounts for the unique properties and challenges of the malware data distribution. Through extensive evaluation on large-scale Windows and Android malware datasets, we show that MADAR significantly outperforms prior work. This highlights the importance of understanding domain characteristics when designing CL techniques and demonstrates a path forward for the malware classification domain.

> Attributing APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) malware to their respective groups is crucial for threat intelligence and cybersecurity. However, APT adversaries often conceal their identities, rendering attribution inherently adversarial. Existing machine learning-based attribution models, while effective, remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. For example, the state-of-the-art byte-level model MalConv sees its accuracy drop from over 90% to below 2% under PGD (projected gradient descent) attacks. Existing gradient-based adversarial training techniques for malware detection or image processing were applied to malware attribution in this study, revealing that both robustness and training efficiency require significant improvement. To address this, we propose RoMA, a novel single-step adversarial training approach that integrates global perturbations to generate enhanced adversarial samples and employs adversarial consistency regularization to improve representation quality and resilience. A novel APT malware dataset named AMG18, with diverse samples and realistic class imbalances, is introduced for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that RoMA significantly outperforms seven competing methods in both adversarial robustness (e.g., achieving over 80% robust accuracy-more than twice that of the next-best method under PGD attacks) and training efficiency (e.g., more than twice as fast as the second-best method in terms of accuracy), while maintaining superior standard accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios.

> The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g., assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The end-to-end decompile method based on large langauge models (LLMs) reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf{ReF Decompile} method, which incorporates the following innovations: (1) The Relabelling strategy replaces jump target addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable information from binary files. Experimental results on the Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of $61.43\%$.

> In this work, we present a series of structure transformation attacks on LLM alignment, where we encode natural language intent using diverse syntax spaces, ranging from simple structure formats and basic query languages (e.g. SQL) to new novel spaces and syntaxes created entirely by LLMs. Our extensive evaluation shows that our simplest attacks can achieve close to 90% success rate, even on strict LLMs (such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using SOTA alignment mechanisms. We improve the attack performance further by using an adaptive scheme that combines structure transformations along with existing \textit{content transformations}, resulting in over 96% ASR with 0% refusals.   To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including syntaxes purely generated by LLMs. Our results indicate that such novel syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process. Finally, we develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it, showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR. Our results show that existing safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research efforts in this direction. As a case study, we demonstrate how attackers can use our attack to easily generate a sample malware, and a corpus of fraudulent SMS messages, which perform well in bypassing detection.

> Malware attacks pose a significant threat in today's interconnected digital landscape, causing billions of dollars in damages. Detecting and identifying families as early as possible provides an edge in protecting against such malware. We explore a lightweight, order-invariant approach to detecting and mitigating malware threats: analyzing API calls without regard to their sequence. We publish a public dataset of over three hundred thousand samples and their function call parameters for this task, annotated with labels indicating benign or malicious activity. The complete dataset is above 550GB uncompressed in size. We leverage machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, and conduct behavioral analysis by examining patterns and anomalies in API call sequences. By investigating how the function calls occur regardless of their order, we can identify discriminating features that can help us identify malware early on. The models we've developed are not only effective but also efficient. They are lightweight and can run on any machine with minimal performance overhead, while still achieving an impressive F1-Score of over 85\%. We also empirically show that we only need a subset of the function call sequence, specifically calls to the ntdll.dll library, to identify malware. Our research demonstrates the efficacy of this approach through empirical evaluations, underscoring its accuracy and scalability. The code is open source and available at Github along with the dataset on Zenodo.

> Ransomware and other forms of malware cause significant financial and operational damage to organizations by exploiting long-standing and often difficult-to-detect software vulnerabilities. To detect vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows in compiled code, this research investigates the application of unidirectional transformer-based embeddings, specifically GPT-2. Using a dataset of LLVM functions, we trained a GPT-2 model to generate embeddings, which were subsequently used to build LSTM neural networks to differentiate between vulnerable and non-vulnerable code. Our study reveals that embeddings from the GPT-2 model significantly outperform those from bidirectional models of BERT and RoBERTa, achieving an accuracy of 92.5% and an F1-score of 89.7%. LSTM neural networks were developed with both frozen and unfrozen embedding model layers. The model with the highest performance was achieved when the embedding layers were unfrozen. Further, the research finds that, in exploring the impact of different optimizers within this domain, the SGD optimizer demonstrates superior performance over Adam. Overall, these findings reveal important insights into the potential of unidirectional transformer-based approaches in enhancing cybersecurity defenses.

> The rapid growth of mobile applications has escalated Android malware threats. Although there are numerous detection methods, they often struggle with evolving attacks, dataset biases, and limited explainability. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their zero-shot inference and reasoning capabilities. However, applying LLMs to Android malware detection presents two key challenges: (1)the extensive support code in Android applications, often spanning thousands of classes, exceeds LLMs' context limits and obscures malicious behavior within benign functionality; (2)the structural complexity and interdependencies of Android applications surpass LLMs' sequence-based reasoning, fragmenting code analysis and hindering malicious intent inference. To address these challenges, we propose LAMD, a practical context-driven framework to enable LLM-based Android malware detection. LAMD integrates key context extraction to isolate security-critical code regions and construct program structures, then applies tier-wise code reasoning to analyze application behavior progressively, from low-level instructions to high-level semantics, providing final prediction and explanation. A well-designed factual consistency verification mechanism is equipped to mitigate LLM hallucinations from the first tier. Evaluation in real-world settings demonstrates LAMD's effectiveness over conventional detectors, establishing a feasible basis for LLM-driven malware analysis in dynamic threat landscapes.

> This manuscript explores the cybersecurity challenges of Operational Technology (OT) networks, focusing on their critical role in industrial environments such as manufacturing, energy, and utilities. As OT systems increasingly integrate with Information Technology (IT) systems due to Industry 4.0 initiatives, they become more vulnerable to cyberattacks, which pose risks not only to data but also to physical infrastructure. The study examines key components of OT systems, such as SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), and RTUs (Remote Terminal Units), and analyzes recent cyberattacks targeting OT environments. Furthermore, it highlights the security concerns arising from the convergence of IT and OT systems, examining attack vectors and the growing threats posed by malware, ransomware, and nation-state actors. Finally, the paper discusses modern approaches and tools used to secure these environments, providing insights into improving the cybersecurity posture of OT networks.

> Concept drift refers to gradual or sudden changes in the properties of data that affect the accuracy of machine learning models. In this paper, we address the problem of concept drift detection in the malware domain. Specifically, we propose and analyze a clustering-based approach to detecting concept drift. Using a subset of the KronoDroid dataset, malware samples are partitioned into temporal batches and analyzed using MiniBatch $K$-Means clustering. The silhouette coefficient is used as a metric to identify points in time where concept drift has likely occurred. To verify our drift detection results, we train learning models under three realistic scenarios, which we refer to as static training, periodic retraining, and drift-aware retraining. In each scenario, we consider four supervised classifiers, namely, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost. Experimental results demonstrate that drift-aware retraining guided by silhouette coefficient thresholding achieves classification accuracy far superior to static models, and generally within 1% of periodic retraining, while also being far more efficient than periodic retraining. These results provide strong evidence that our clustering-based approach is effective at detecting concept drift, while also illustrating a highly practical and efficient fully automated approach to improved malware classification via concept drift detection.

> Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) is widely used in various binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability search, malware detection, clone detection, and patch analysis. Recent studies have shown that the learning-based binary code embedding models perform better than the traditional feature-based approaches. However, previous studies have not delved deeply into the key factors that affect model performance. In this paper, we design extensive ablation studies to explore these influencing factors. The experimental results have provided us with many new insights. We have made innovations in both code representation and model selection: we propose a novel rich-semantic function representation technique to ensure the model captures the intricate nuances of binary code, and we introduce the first UniLM-based binary code embedding model, named UniASM, which includes two newly designed training tasks to learn representations of binary functions. The experimental results show that UniASM outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the evaluation datasets. The average scores of Recall@1 on cross-compilers, cross-optimization-levels, and cross-obfuscations have improved by 12.7%, 8.5%, and 22.3%, respectively, compared to the best of the baseline methods. Besides, in the real-world task of known vulnerability search, UniASM outperforms all the current baselines.

- `2502.15041v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15041v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15041v1)

> Android malware detection has been extensively studied using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. While many state-of-the-art detection models, particularly those based on DL, claim superior performance, they often rely on limited comparisons, lacking comprehensive benchmarking against traditional ML models across diverse datasets. This raises concerns about the robustness of DL-based approaches' performance and the potential oversight of simpler, more efficient ML models. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Android malware detection models across four datasets: three recently published, publicly available datasets and a large-scale dataset we systematically collected. We implement a range of traditional ML models, including Random Forests (RF) and CatBoost, alongside advanced DL models such as Capsule Graph Neural Networks (CapsGNN), BERT-based models, and ExcelFormer based models. Our results reveal that while advanced DL models can achieve strong performance, they are often compared against an insufficient number of traditional ML baselines. In many cases, simpler and more computationally efficient ML models achieve comparable or even superior performance. These findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking in Android malware detection research. We encourage future studies to conduct more comprehensive benchmarking comparisons between traditional and advanced models to ensure a more accurate assessment of detection capabilities. To facilitate further research, we provide access to our dataset, including app IDs, hash values, and labels.

> The persistent threat posed by malicious domain names in cyber-attacks underscores the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. Traditional machine learning methods, while capable of identifying such domains, often suffer from high false positive and false negative rates due to their extensive reliance on historical data. Conventional approaches often overlook the dynamic nature of domain names, the purposes and ownership of which may evolve, potentially rendering risk assessments outdated or irrelevant. To address these shortcomings, we introduce DomainDynamics, a novel system designed to predict domain name risks by considering their lifecycle stages. DomainDynamics constructs a timeline for each domain, evaluating the characteristics of each domain at various points in time to make informed, temporal risk determinations. In an evaluation experiment involving over 85,000 actual malicious domains from malware and phishing incidents, DomainDynamics demonstrated a significant improvement in detection rates, achieving an 82.58\% detection rate with a low false positive rate of 0.41\%. This performance surpasses that of previous studies and commercial services, improving detection capability substantially.

> Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are vulnerable to malware and require new mitigation techniques due to their limited resources. To that end, previous research has used periodic Remote Attestation (RA) or Traffic Analysis (TA) to detect malware in IoT devices. However, RA is expensive, and TA only raises suspicion without confirming malware presence. To solve this, we design MADEA, the first system that blends RA and TA to offer a comprehensive approach to malware detection for the IoT ecosystem. TA builds profiles of expected packet traces during benign operations of each device and then uses them to detect malware from network traffic in real-time. RA confirms the presence or absence of malware on the device. MADEA achieves 100% true positive rate. It also outperforms other approaches with 160x faster detection time. Finally, without MADEA, effective periodic RA can consume at least ~14x the amount of energy that a device needs in one hour.

> As networks continue to expand and become more interconnected, the need for novel malware detection methods becomes more pronounced. Traditional security measures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber attacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network security, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses conventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. While the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection and network traffic classification, state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches are limited by their reliance on large amounts of annotated data and their inability to generalize to novel, unseen malware threats. To address these limitations, this paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL). Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer via SSL to learn the embedding of packet content, including payload, from vast amounts of unlabeled data by masking portions of packets, leading to a learned representation that generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from the packets, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the transformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of attacks using few-shot learning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of up to 94.76% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 83.25% on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.

> With the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT, non-decisional models have been applied to various tasks. Moreover, ChatGPT has drawn attention to the traditional decision-centric task of Android malware detection. Despite effective detection methods proposed by scholars, they face low interpretability issues. Specifically, while these methods excel in classifying applications as benign or malicious and can detect malicious behavior, they often fail to provide detailed explanations for the decisions they make. This challenge raises concerns about the reliability of existing detection schemes and questions their true ability to understand complex data. In this study, we investigate the influence of the non-decisional model, ChatGPT, on the traditional decision-centric task of Android malware detection. We choose three state-of-the-art solutions, Drebin, XMAL, and MaMaDroid, conduct a series of experiments on publicly available datasets, and carry out a comprehensive comparison and analysis. Our findings indicate that these decision-driven solutions primarily rely on statistical patterns within datasets to make decisions, rather than genuinely understanding the underlying data. In contrast, ChatGPT, as a non-decisional model, excels in providing comprehensive analysis reports, substantially enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, we conduct surveys among experienced developers. The result highlights developers' preference for ChatGPT, as it offers in-depth insights and enhances efficiency and understanding of challenges. Meanwhile, these studies and analyses offer profound insights, presenting developers with a novel perspective on Android malware detection--enhancing the reliability of detection results from a non-decisional perspective.

> Typosquatting attacks, also known as package confusion attacks, threaten software supply chains. Attackers make packages with names that resemble legitimate ones, tricking engineers into installing malware. While prior work has developed defenses against typosquatting in some software package registries, notably npm and PyPI, gaps remain: addressing high false-positive rates; generalizing to more software package ecosystems; and gaining insight from real-world deployment.   In this work, we introduce TypoSmart, a solution designed to address the challenges posed by typosquatting attacks. We begin by conducting a novel analysis of typosquatting data to gain deeper insights into attack patterns and engineering practices. Building on state-of-the-art approaches, we extend support to six software package registries using embedding-based similarity search, achieving a 73%-91% improvement in speed. Additionally, our approach significantly reduces 70.4% false-positive compared to prior work results. TypoSmart is being used in production at our industry partner and contributed to the removal of 3,658 typosquatting packages in one month. We share lessons learned from the production deployment.

To address this issue, we propose a deep learning framework enhanced with a genetic algorithm to improve malware classification accuracy and adaptability. Our approach incorporates mutation operations and fitness score evaluations within genetic algorithms to continuously refine the deep learning model, ensuring robustness against evolving malware threats. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid method significantly enhances classification performance and adaptability, outperforming traditional static models. Our proposed approach offers a promising solution for real-time malware classification in ever-changing cybersecurity landscapes.
