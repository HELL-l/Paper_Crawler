> Previous work on home router security has shown that using system calls to train a transformer-based language model built on a BERT-style encoder using contrastive learning is effective in detecting several types of malware, but the performance remains limited at low false positive rates. In this work, we demonstrate that using a high-fidelity eBPF-based system call sensor, together with contrastive augmented learning (which introduces controlled mutations of negative samples), improves detection performance at a low false positive rate. In addition, we introduce a network packet abstraction language that enables the creation of a pipeline similar to network packet data, and we show that network behavior provides complementary detection signals-yielding improved performance for network-focused malware at low false positive rates. Lastly, we implement these methods in an online router anomaly detection framework to validate the approach in an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment environment.

- *Guoqiang Chen, Lingyun Ying, Ziyang Song, Daguang Liu, Qiang Wang, Zhiqi Wang, Li Hu, Shaoyin Cheng, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu*

- `2512.10393v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10393v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10393v2)

> Retrieving binary code via natural language queries is a pivotal capability for downstream tasks in the software security domain, such as vulnerability detection and malware analysis. However, it is challenging to identify binary functions semantically relevant to the user query from thousands of candidates, as the absence of symbolic information distinguishes this task from source code retrieval. In this paper, we introduce, BinSeek, a two-stage cross-modal retrieval framework for stripped binary code analysis. It consists of two models: BinSeek-Embedding is trained on large-scale dataset to learn the semantic relevance of the binary code and the natural language description, furthermore, BinSeek-Reranker learns to carefully judge the relevance of the candidate code to the description with context augmentation. To this end, we built an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline to automate training construction, also deriving a domain benchmark for future research. Our evaluation results show that BinSeek achieved the state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the the same scale models by 31.42% in Rec@3 and 27.17% in MRR@3, as well as leading the advanced general-purpose models that have 16 times larger parameters.

> Artificial Intelligence's dual-use nature is revolutionizing the cybersecurity landscape, introducing new threats across four main categories: deepfakes and synthetic media, adversarial AI attacks, automated malware, and AI-powered social engineering. This paper aims to analyze emerging risks, attack mechanisms, and defense shortcomings related to AI in cybersecurity. We introduce a comparative taxonomy connecting AI capabilities with threat modalities and defenses, review over 70 academic and industry references, and identify impactful opportunities for research, such as hybrid detection pipelines and benchmarking frameworks. The paper is structured thematically by threat type, with each section addressing technical context, real-world incidents, legal frameworks, and countermeasures. Our findings emphasize the urgency for explainable, interdisciplinary, and regulatory-compliant AI defense systems to maintain trust and security in digital ecosystems.

<summary>2026-01-07 08:33:24 - Kitten or Panda? Measuring the Specificity of Threat Group Behaviors in Public CTI Knowledge Bases</summary>

- *Aakanksha Saha, Martina Lindorfer, Juan Caballero*

- `2506.10645v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10645v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10645v2)

> In recent years, the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) community has invested significant effort in building knowledge bases that catalog threat groups. These knowledge bases associate each threat group with its observed behaviors, including their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) as well as the malware and tools they employ during attacks. However, the distinctiveness and completeness of such behavioral profiles remain largely unexplored, despite being critical for tasks such as threat group attribution. In this work, we systematically analyze threat group profiles built from two public CTI knowledge bases: MITRE ATT&CK and Malpedia. We first investigate what fraction of threat groups have group-specific behaviors, i.e., behaviors used exclusively by a single group. We find that only 34% of threat groups in ATT&CK have group-specific techniques, limiting the use of techniques as reliable behavioral signatures to identify the threat group behind an attack. The software used by a threat group proves to be more distinctive, with 73% of ATT&CK groups using group-specific software. However, this percentage drops to 24% in the broader Malpedia dataset. Next, we evaluate how group profiles improve when data from both sources are combined. While coverage improves modestly, the proportion of groups with group-specific behaviors remains under 30%. We then enhance profiles by adding exploited vulnerabilities and additional techniques extracted from threat reports. Despite the additional information, 64% of groups still lack any group-specific behavior. Our findings raise concerns about the specificity of existing behavioral profiles and highlight the need for caution, as well as further improvement, when using them for threat group attribution.

<summary>2026-01-07 16:18:48 - Lightweight and Resilient Signatures for Cloud-Assisted Embedded IoT Systems</summary>

- *Saif E. Nouma, Attila A. Yavuz*

- `2409.13937v4` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13937v4) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13937v4)

> Digital signatures provide scalable authentication with non-repudiation and are vital tools for the Internet of Things (IoT). Many IoT applications harbor vast quantities of resource-limited devices often used with cloud computing. However, key compromises (e.g., physical, malware) pose a significant threat to IoTs due to increased attack vectors and open operational environments. Forward security and distributed key management are critical breach-resilient countermeasures to mitigate such threats. Yet forward-secure signatures are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoTs, while cloud-assisted approaches suffer from centrality or non-colluding semi-honest servers. In this work, we create two novel digital signatures called Lightweight and Resilient Signatures with Hardware Assistance (LRSHA) and its Forward-secure version (FLRSHA). They offer a near-optimally efficient signing with small keys and signature sizes. We synergize various design strategies, such as commitment separation to eliminate costly signing operations and hardware-assisted distributed servers to enable breach-resilient verification. Our schemes achieve magnitudes of faster forward-secure signing and compact key/signature sizes without suffering from strong security assumptions (non-colluding, central servers) or a heavy burden on the verifier (extreme storage, computation). We formally prove the security of our schemes and validate their performance with full-fledged open-source implementations on both commodity hardware and 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.

<summary>2026-01-08 03:30:20 - Deep Dive into the Abuse of DL APIs To Create Malicious AI Models and How to Detect Them</summary>

- *Mohamed Nabeel, Oleksii Starov*

- `2601.04553v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04553v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04553v1)

> According to Gartner, more than 70% of organizations will have integrated AI models into their workflows by the end of 2025. In order to reduce cost and foster innovation, it is often the case that pre-trained models are fetched from model hubs like Hugging Face or TensorFlow Hub. However, this introduces a security risk where attackers can inject malicious code into the models they upload to these hubs, leading to various kinds of attacks including remote code execution (RCE), sensitive data exfiltration, and system file modification when these models are loaded or executed (predict function). Since AI models play a critical role in digital transformation, this would drastically increase the number of software supply chain attacks. While there are several efforts at detecting malware when deserializing pickle based saved models (hiding malware in model parameters), the risk of abusing DL APIs (e.g. TensorFlow APIs) is understudied. Specifically, we show how one can abuse hidden functionalities of TensorFlow APIs such as file read/write and network send/receive along with their persistence APIs to launch attacks. It is concerning to note that existing scanners in model hubs like Hugging Face and TensorFlow Hub are unable to detect some of the stealthy abuse of such APIs. This is because scanning tools only have a syntactically identified set of suspicious functionality that is being analysed. They often do not have a semantic-level understanding of the functionality utilized. After demonstrating the possible attacks, we show how one may identify potentially abusable hidden API functionalities using LLMs and build scanners to detect such abuses.

<summary>2026-01-08 09:17:08 - BIDO: An Out-Of-Distribution Resistant Image-based Malware Detector</summary>

- *Wei Wang, Junhui Li, Chengbin Feng, Zhiwei Yang, Qi Mo*

- `2509.03807v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03807v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03807v2)

> While image-based detectors have shown promise in Android malware detection, they often struggle to maintain their performance and interpretability when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Specifically, OOD samples generated by code obfuscation and concept drift exhibit distributions that significantly deviate from the detector's training data. Such shifts not only severely undermine the generalisation of detectors to OOD samples but also compromise the reliability of their associated interpretations. To address these challenges, we propose BIDO, a novel generative classifier that reformulates malware detection as a likelihood estimation task. Unlike conventional discriminative methods, BIDO jointly produces classification results and interpretations by explicitly modeling class-conditional distributions, thereby resolving the long-standing separation between detection and explanation. Empirical results demonstrate that BIDO substantially enhances robustness against extreme obfuscation and concept drift while achieving reliable interpretation without sacrificing performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/whatishope/BIDO/.

- *Mustafa F. Abdelwahed, Joan Espasa, Alice Toniolo, Ian P. Gent*

- `2601.04911v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04911v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.04911v1)

> The primary objective of a diverse planning approach is to generate a set of plans that are distinct from one another. Such an approach is applied in a variety of real-world domains, including risk management, automated stream data analysis, and malware detection. More recently, a novel diverse planning paradigm, referred to as behaviour planning, has been proposed. This approach extends earlier methods by explicitly incorporating a diversity model into the planning process and supporting multiple planning categories. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of behaviour planning in real-world settings by presenting three case studies. The first case study focuses on storytelling, the second addresses urban planning, and the third examines game evaluation.

- *Keerthi Kumar. M, Swarun Kumar Joginpelly, Sunil Khemka, Lakshmi. S R, Navin Chhibber*

- `2601.06213v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06213v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06213v1)

> Background: Cyber-attacks have evolved rapidly in recent years, many individuals and business owners have been affected by cyber-attacks in various ways. Cyber-attacks include various threats such as ransomware, malware, phishing, and Denial of Service (DoS)-related attacks. Challenges: Traditional models such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Security Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) were implemented to detect cyber threats. However, the existing Security BERT model has a limited contextual understanding of text data, which has less impact on detecting cyber-attacks. Proposed Methodology: To overcome the above-mentioned challenges, Robustly Optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) model is proposed which consists of diverse words of vocabulary understanding. Initially, data are extracted from a Packet Capture (PCAP) file and encrypted using Fully Harmonic Encryption (FHE). Subsequently, a Byte-level and Byte Pair Encoding (BBPE) tokenizer was used to generate tokens and help maintain the vocabulary for the encrypted values. Then, these values are applied to the RoBERTa model of the transformer with extensive training. Finally, Softmax is used for the detection and classification of attacks. The proposed RoBERTa model achieved better results than the existing BERT model in terms of accuracy (0.99), recall (0.91), and precision (0.89) respectively.

- *Rakesh Keshava, Sathish Kuppan Pandurangan, M. Sakthivanitha, Sankaranainar Parmsivan, Goutham Sunkara, R. Maruthi*

- `2601.06219v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06219v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06219v1)

> The rise in frequency and complexity of malware attacks are viewed as a major threat to modern digital infrastructure, which means that traditional signature-based detection methods are becoming less effective. As cyber threats continue to evolve, there is a growing need for intelligent systems to accurately and proactively identify and prevent malware infections. This study presents a new hybrid context-aware malware detection framework(HCAMDF) based on artificial intelligence (AI), which combines static file analysis, dynamic behavioural analysis, and contextual metadata to provide more accurate and timely detection. HCADMF has a multi-layer architecture, which consists of lightweight static classifiers such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) for real-time behavioral analysis, and an ensemble risk scoring through the integration of multiple layers of prediction. Experimental evaluations of the new/methodology with benchmark datasets, EMBER and CIC-MalMem2022, showed that the new approach provides superior performances with an accuracy of 97.3%, only a 1.5% false positive rate and minimal detection delay compared to several existing machine learning(ML) and deep learning(DL) established methods in the same fields. The results show strong evidence that hybrid AI can detect both existing and novel malware variants, and lay the foundation on intelligent security systems that can enable real-time detection and adapt to a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

- *Imtiaz Ali Soomro, Hamood Ur Rehman, S. Jawad Hussain ID, Adeel Iqbal, Waqas Khalid, Heejung Yu ID*

- `2601.06466v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06466v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06466v1)

> The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across domains such as smart homes, industrial control systems, and healthcare networks has significantly expanded the attack surface for cyber threats, including botnet-driven distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), malware injection, and data exfiltration. Conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) face critical challenges like privacy, scalability, and robustness when applied in such heterogeneous IoT environments. To address these issues, we propose SecureDyn-FL, a comprehensive and robust privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework tailored for intrusion detection in IoT networks. SecureDyn-FL is designed to simultaneously address multiple security dimensions in FL-based IDS: (1) poisoning detection through dynamic temporal gradient auditing, (2) privacy protection against inference and eavesdropping attacks through secure aggregation, and (3) adaptation to heterogeneous non-IID data via personalized learning. The framework introduces three core contributions: (i) a dynamic temporal gradient auditing mechanism that leverages Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) to detect stealthy and adaptive poisoning attacks, (ii) an optimized privacy-preserving aggregation scheme based on transformed additive ElGamal encryption with adaptive pruning and quantization for secure and efficient communication, and (iii) a dual-objective personalized learning strategy that improves model adaptation under non-IID data using logit-adjusted loss. Extensive experiments on the N-BaIoT dataset under both IID and non-IID settings, including scenarios with up to 50% adversarial clients, demonstrate that SecureDyn-FL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based IDS defenses.

> Modern software package registries like PyPI have become critical infrastructure for software development, but are increasingly exploited by threat actors distributing malicious packages with sophisticated multi-stage attack chains. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for automated code analysis, their application to security-critical malware detection faces fundamental challenges, including hallucination and context confusion, which can lead to missed detections or false alarms. We present CHASE (Collaborative Hierarchical Agents for Security Exploration), a high-reliability multi-agent architecture that addresses these limitations through a Plan-and-Execute coordination model, specialized Worker Agents focused on specific analysis aspects, and integration with deterministic security tools for critical operations. Our key insight is that reliability in LLM-based security analysis emerges not from improving individual model capabilities but from architecting systems that compensate for LLM weaknesses while leveraging their semantic understanding strengths. Evaluation on a dataset of 3,000 packages (500 malicious, 2,500 benign) demonstrates that CHASE achieves 98.4% recall with only 0.08% false positive rate, while maintaining a practical median analysis time of 4.5 minutes per package, making it suitable for operational deployment in automated package screening. Furthermore, we conducted a survey with cybersecurity professionals to evaluate the generated analysis reports, identifying their key strengths and areas for improvement. This work provides a blueprint for building reliable AI-powered security tools that can scale with the growing complexity of modern software supply chains.

- `2601.07305v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07305v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07305v1)

> Artificial intelligence and machine learning have significantly advanced malware research by enabling automated threat detection and behavior analysis. However, the availability of exploitable data is limited, due to the absence of large datasets with real-world data. Despite the progress of AI in cybersecurity, malware analysis still suffers from this data scarcity, which limits model generalization. In order to tackle this difficulty, this workinvestigates TabPFN, a learning-free model designed for low-data regimes. We evaluate its performance against established baselines such as Random Forest, LightGBM and XGBoost, across multiple class configurations. Our experimental results indicate that TabPFN surpasses all other models in low-data regimes, with a 2% to 6% improvement observed across multiple performance metrics. However, this increase in performance has an impact on its computation time in a particular case. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of integrating TabPFN into cybersecurity workflows.

> Large Language Models have emerged as transformative tools for Security Operations Centers, enabling automated log analysis, phishing triage, and malware explanation; however, deployment in adversarial cybersecurity environments exposes critical vulnerabilities to prompt injection attacks where malicious instructions embedded in security artifacts manipulate model behavior. This paper introduces SecureCAI, a novel defense framework extending Constitutional AI principles with security-aware guardrails, adaptive constitution evolution, and Direct Preference Optimization for unlearning unsafe response patterns, addressing the unique challenges of high-stakes security contexts where traditional safety mechanisms prove insufficient against sophisticated adversarial manipulation. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that SecureCAI reduces attack success rates by 94.7% compared to baseline models while maintaining 95.1% accuracy on benign security analysis tasks, with the framework incorporating continuous red-teaming feedback loops enabling dynamic adaptation to emerging attack strategies and achieving constitution adherence scores exceeding 0.92 under sustained adversarial pressure, thereby establishing a foundation for trustworthy integration of language model capabilities into operational cybersecurity workflows and addressing a critical gap in current approaches to AI safety within adversarial domains.

- `2405.14519v2` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14519v2) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14519v2)

> Machine learning malware detectors are vulnerable to adversarial EXEmples, i.e., carefully-crafted Windows programs tailored to evade detection. Unlike other adversarial problems, attacks in this context must be functionality-preserving, a constraint that is challenging to address. As a consequence, heuristic algorithms are typically used, which inject new content, either randomly-picked or harvested from legitimate programs. In this paper, we show how learning malware detectors can be cast within a zeroth-order optimization framework, which allows incorporating functionality-preserving manipulations. This permits the deployment of sound and efficient gradient-free optimization algorithms, which come with theoretical guarantees and allow for minimal hyper-parameters tuning. As a by-product, we propose and study ZEXE, a novel zeroth-order attack against Windows malware detection. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, ZEXE provides improvement in the evasion rate, reducing to less than one third the size of the injected content.

- *Mingqi Lv, Shanshan Zhang, Haiwen Liu, Tieming Chen, Tiantian Zhu*

- `2601.08328v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08328v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08328v1)

> Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are stealthy and multi-stage, making single-point defenses (e.g., malware- or traffic-based detectors) ill-suited to capture long-range and cross-entity attack semantics. Provenance-graph analysis has become a prominent approach for APT detection. However, its practical deployment is hampered by (i) the scarcity of APT samples, (ii) the cost and difficulty of fine-grained APT sample labeling, and (iii) the diversity of attack tactics and techniques. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposes APT-MCL, an intelligent APT detection system based on Multi-view Collaborative provenance graph Learning. It adopts an unsupervised learning strategy to discover APT attacks at the node level via anomaly detection. After that, it creates multiple anomaly detection sub-models based on multi-view features and integrates them within a collaborative learning framework to adapt to diverse attack scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world APT datasets validate the approach: (i) multi-view features improve cross-scenario generalization, and (ii) co-training substantially boosts node-level detection under label scarcity, enabling practical deployment on diverse attack scenarios.

> This study independently reproduces the malware detection methodology presented by Felli cious et al. [7], which employs order-invariant API call frequency analysis using Random Forest classification. We utilized the original public dataset (250,533 training samples, 83,511 test samples) and replicated four model variants: Unigram, Bigram, Trigram, and Combined n gram approaches. Our reproduction successfully validated all key findings, achieving F1-scores that exceeded the original results by 0.99% to 2.57% across all models at the optimal API call length of 2,500. The Unigram model achieved F1=0.8717 (original: 0.8631), confirming its ef fectiveness as a lightweight malware detector. Across three independent experimental runs with different random seeds, we observed remarkably consistent results with standard deviations be low 0.5%, demonstrating high reproducibility. This study validates the robustness and scientific rigor of the original methodology while confirming the practical viability of frequency-based API call analysis for malware detection.

- *Md Mashrur Arifin, Maqsudur Rahman, Nasir U. Eisty*

- `2601.08959v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08959v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08959v1)

> As zero-day Android malware attacks grow more sophisticated, recent research highlights the effectiveness of using image-based representations of malware bytecode to detect previously unseen threats. However, existing studies often overlook how image type and resolution affect detection and ignore valuable textual data in Android Application Packages (APKs), such as permissions and metadata, limiting their ability to fully capture malicious behavior. The integration of multimodality, which combines image and text data, has gained momentum as a promising approach to address these limitations. This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework integrating APK images and textual features to enhance Android malware detection. We systematically evaluate various image types and resolutions across different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, including VGG, ResNet-152, MobileNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet-B4, and use LLaMA-2, a large language model, to extract and annotate textual features for improved analysis. The findings demonstrate that RGB images at higher resolutions (e.g., 256x256, 512x512) achieve superior classification performance, while the multimodal integration of image and text using the CLIP model reveals limited potential. Overall, this research highlights the importance of systematically evaluating image attributes and integrating multimodal data to develop effective malware detection for Android systems.

> Enterprise security faces escalating threats from sophisticated malware, compounded by expanding digital operations. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of large language models (LLMs) to proactively identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) from unstructured web-based threat intelligence sources, distinguishing it from reactive malware detection approaches. We developed an automated system that pulls IOCs from 15 web-based threat report sources to evaluate six LLM models (Gemini, Qwen, and Llama variants). Our evaluation of 479 webpages containing 2,658 IOCs (711 IPv4 addresses, 502 IPv6 addresses, 1,445 domains) reveals significant performance variations. Gemini 1.5 Pro achieved 0.958 precision and 0.788 specificity for malicious IOC identification, while demonstrating perfect recall (1.0) for actual threats.

> The parallel evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced code-understanding capabilities and the increasing sophistication of malware presents a new frontier for cybersecurity research. This paper evaluates the efficacy of state-of-the-art LLMs in classifying executable code as either benign or malicious. We introduce an automated pipeline that first decompiles Windows executable into a C code using Ghidra disassembler and then leverages LLMs to perform the classification. Our evaluation reveals that while standard LLMs show promise, they are not yet robust enough to replace traditional anti-virus software. We demonstrate that a fine-tuned model, trained on curated malware and benign datasets, significantly outperforms its vanilla counterpart. However, the performance of even this specialized model degrades notably when encountering newer malware. This finding demonstrates the critical need for continuous fine-tuning with emerging threats to maintain model effectiveness against the changing coding patterns and behaviors of malicious software.

- *Ben Nassi, Bruce Schneier, Oleg Brodt*

- `2601.09625v1` - [abs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09625v1) - [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09625v1)

> The rapid adoption of large language model (LLM)-based systems -- from chatbots to autonomous agents capable of executing code and financial transactions -- has created a new attack surface that existing security frameworks inadequately address. The dominant framing of these threats as "prompt injection" -- a catch-all phrase for security failures in LLM-based systems -- obscures a more complex reality: Attacks on LLM-based systems increasingly involve multi-step sequences that mirror traditional malware campaigns. In this paper, we propose that attacks targeting LLM-based applications constitute a distinct class of malware, which we term \textit{promptware}, and introduce a five-step kill chain model for analyzing these threats. The framework comprises Initial Access (prompt injection), Privilege Escalation (jailbreaking), Persistence (memory and retrieval poisoning), Lateral Movement (cross-system and cross-user propagation), and Actions on Objective (ranging from data exfiltration to unauthorized transactions). By mapping recent attacks to this structure, we demonstrate that LLM-related attacks follow systematic sequences analogous to traditional malware campaigns. The promptware kill chain offers security practitioners a structured methodology for threat modeling and provides a common vocabulary for researchers across AI safety and cybersecurity to address a rapidly evolving threat landscape.

> Android malware has become an increasingly critical threat to organizations, society and individuals, posing significant risks to privacy, data security and infrastructure. As malware continues to evolve in terms of complexity and sophistication, the mitigation and detection of these malicious software instances have become more time consuming and challenging particularly due to the requirement of large number of features to identify potential malware. To address these challenges, this research proposes Fast Gradient Sign Method with Diluted Convolutional Neural Network (FGSM DICNN) method for malware classification. DICNN contains diluted convolutions which increases receptive field, enabling the model to capture dispersed malware patterns across long ranges using fewer features without adding parameters. Additionally, the FGSM strategy enhance the accuracy by using one-step perturbations during training that provides more defensive advantage of lower computational cost. This integration helps to manage high classification accuracy while reducing the dependence on extensive feature sets. The proposed FGSM DICNN model attains 99.44% accuracy while outperforming other existing approaches such as Custom Deep Neural Network (DCNN).

> The rapid growth of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the interconnection of computational resources, creating an environment where malicious software (malware) can spread rapidly. To address this challenge, researchers are increasingly utilizing Machine Learning approaches to identify malware through behavioral (i.e. dynamic) cues. However, current approaches are limited by their reliance on large labeled datasets, fixed model training, and the assumption that a trained model remains effective over time-disregarding the ever-evolving sophistication of malware. As a result, they often fail to detect evolving malware attacks that adapt over time. This paper proposes an online learning approach for dynamic malware detection, that overcomes these limitations by incorporating temporal information to continuously update its models using behavioral features, specifically process resource utilization metrics. By doing so, the proposed models can incrementally adapt to emerging threats and detect zero-day malware effectively. Upon evaluating our approach against traditional batch algorithms, we find it effective in detecting zero-day malware. Moreover, we demonstrate its efficacy in scenarios with limited data availability, where traditional batch-based approaches often struggle to perform reliably.

> Large multimodal model powered GUI agents are emerging as high-privilege operators on mobile platforms, entrusted with perceiving screen content and injecting inputs. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.   We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.   We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

> The increasing cyber threats to critical infrastructure highlight the importance of private companies and government agencies in detecting and sharing information about threat activities. Although the need for improved threat information sharing is widely recognized, various technical and organizational challenges persist, hindering effective collaboration. In this study, we review the challenges that disturb the sharing of usable threat information to critical infrastructure operators within the ICS domain. We analyze three major incidents: Stuxnet, Industroyer, and Triton. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of 196 procedure examples across 79 MITRE ATT&CK techniques from 22 ICS-related malware families, utilizing automated natural language processing techniques to systematically extract and categorize threat observables. Additionally, we investigated nine recent ICS vulnerability advisories from the CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability catalog. Our analysis identified four important limitations in the ICS threat information sharing ecosystem: (i) the lack of coherent representation of artifacts related to ICS adversarial techniques in information sharing language standards (e.g., STIX); (ii) the dependence on undocumented proprietary technologies; (iii) limited technical details provided in vulnerability and threat incident reports; and (iv) the accessibility of technical details for observed adversarial techniques. This study aims to guide the development of future information-sharing standards, including the enhancement of the cyber-observable objects schema in STIX, to ensure accurate representation of artifacts specific to ICS environments.

> The increasing prevalence of malicious Portable Document Format (PDF) files necessitates robust and comprehensive feature extraction techniques for effective detection and analysis. This work presents a unified framework that integrates graph-based, structural, and metadata-driven analysis to generate a rich feature representation for each PDF document. The system extracts text from PDF pages and constructs undirected graphs based on pairwise word relationships, enabling the computation of graph-theoretic features such as node count, edge density, and clustering coefficient. Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis. The proposed approach is scalable, extensible, and designed to support real-world PDF threat intelligence workflows.6

> Malware often uses obfuscation to hinder security analysis. Among these techniques, virtualization-based obfuscation is particularly strong because it protects programs by translating original instructions into attacker-defined virtual machine (VM) bytecode, producing long and complex code that is difficult to analyze and deobfuscate. This paper aims to identify the structural components of virtualization-based obfuscation through static analysis. By examining the execution model of obfuscated code, we define and detect the key elements required for deobfuscation-namely the dispatch routine, handler blocks, and the VM region-using LLVM IR. Experimental results show that, in the absence of compiler optimizations, the proposed LLVM Pass successfully detects all core structures across major virtualization options, including switch, direct, and indirect modes.

> In the current era of interconnected cyberspace, there is an adverse effect of ransomware on individuals, startups, and large companies. Cybercriminals hold digital assets till the demand for payment is made. The success of ransomware upsurged with the introduction of Ransomware as a Service(RaaS) franchise in the darknet market. Obfuscation and polymorphic nature of malware make them more difficult to identify by Antivirus system. Signature based intrusion detection is still on role suffering from the scarcity of RaaS packet signatures. We have analysed RaaS samples by network forensic approach to investigate on packet captures of benign and malicious network traffic. The behavior analysis of RaaS family Ransomwares, Ryuk and Gandcrab have been investigated to classify the packets as suspicious, malicious, and non-malicious which further aid in generating RaaS packet signatures for early detection and mitigation of ransomwares belonging to RaaS family. More than 40\% of packets are found malicious in this experiment. The proposed method is also verified by Virus Total API Approach. Further, the proposed approach is recommended for integration into honeypots in the present scenario to combat with data scarcity concerned with malware samples(RaaS). This data will be helpful in developing AI-based threat intelligence mechanisms. In turn enhance detection, prevention of threats, incident response and risk assessment.

> As malware continues to become increasingly sophisticated, threatening, and evasive, malware detection systems must keep pace and become equally intelligent, powerful, and transparent. In this paper, we propose Assembly Flow Graph (AFG) to comprehensively represent the assembly flow of a binary executable as graph data. Importantly, AFG can be used to extract granular explanations needed to increase transparency for malware detection using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, since AFGs may be large in practice, we also propose a Meta-Coarsening approach to improve computational tractability via graph reduction. To evaluate our proposed approach we consider several novel and existing metrics to quantify the granularity and quality of explanations. Lastly, we also consider several hyperparameters in our proposed Meta-Coarsening approach that can be used to control the final explanation size. We evaluate our proposed approach using the CIC-DGG-2025 dataset. Our results indicate that our proposed AFG and Meta-Coarsening approach can provide both increased explainability and inference performance at certain coarsening levels. However, most importantly, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider granular explainability in malware detection using GNNs.

> The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics, neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While prior works established the importance of temporal evaluation and introduced selective classification in malware classification tasks, we take a complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain reliable and stable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not. We propose Aurora, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their confidence quality and operational resilience. Aurora subjects the confidence profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste valuable annotation budgets on non-informative samples for active learning, and leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. Aurora is further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in SOTA frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests it may be time to revisit the underlying assumptions.

> High-dimensional malware datasets often exhibit feature redundancy, instability, and scalability limitations, which hinder the effectiveness and interpretability of machine learning-based malware detection systems. Although feature selection is commonly employed to mitigate these issues, many existing approaches lack robustness when applied to large-scale and heterogeneous malware data. To address this gap, this paper proposes CAFE-GB (Chunk-wise Aggregated Feature Estimation using Gradient Boosting), a scalable feature selection framework designed to produce stable and globally consistent feature rankings for high-dimensional malware detection. CAFE-GB partitions training data into overlapping chunks, estimates local feature importance using gradient boosting models, and aggregates these estimates to derive a robust global ranking. Feature budget selection is performed separately through a systematic k-selection and stability analysis to balance detection performance and robustness. The proposed framework is evaluated on two large-scale malware datasets: BODMAS and CIC-AndMal2020, representing large and diverse malware feature spaces. Experimental results show that classifiers trained on CAFE-GB -selected features achieve performance parity with full-feature baselines across multiple metrics, including Accuracy, F1-score, MCC, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC, while reducing feature dimensionality by more than 95\%. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests confirm that this reduction does not introduce statistically significant performance degradation. Additional analyses demonstrate low inter-feature redundancy and improved interpretability through SHAP-based explanations. Runtime and memory profiling further indicate reduced downstream classification overhead. Overall, CAFE-GB provides a stable, interpretable, and scalable feature selection strategy for large-scale malware detection.

> The increasingly sophisticated environment in which attackers operate makes software security an even greater challenge in open-source projects, where malicious packages are prevalent. Static analysis tools, such as Malcontent, are highly useful but are often incapable of dealing with obfuscated malware. Such situations lead to an unreasonably high rate of false positives. This paper highlights that dynamic analysis, rather than static analysis, provides greater insight but is also more resource-intensive for understanding software behaviour during execution. In this study, we enhance a dynamic analysis tool, package-analysis, to capture key runtime behaviours, including commands executed, files accessed, and network communications. This modification enables the use of container sandboxing technologies, such as gVisor, to analyse potentially malicious packages without significantly compromising the host system.

> In this work, we introduce FOCA, a novel multimodal framework for malware classification that jointly leverages audio and visual modalities. Unlike conventional Euclidean-based fusion methods, FOCA is the first to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical relationships between audio and visual representations within hyperbolic space. To achieve this, raw binaries are transformed into both audio and visual representations, which are then processed through three key components: (i) a hyperbolic projection module that maps Euclidean embeddings into the Poincare ball, (ii) a hyperbolic cross-attention mechanism that aligns multimodal dependencies under curvature-aware constraints, and (iii) a Mobius addition-based fusion layer. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets-Mal-Net and CICMalDroid2020- show that FOCA consistently outperforms unimodal models, surpasses most Euclidean multimodal baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing works.

> Malware classification models often face performance degradation due to concept drift, arising from evolving threat landscapes and the emergence of novel malware families. This paper presents FARM (Few-shot Adaptive Recognition of Malware), a framework designed to detect and adapt to both covariate and label drift in Windows Portable Executable (PE) malware classification. FARM leverages a triplet autoencoder to project samples into a discriminative latent space, enabling unsupervised drift detection via DBSCAN clustering and dynamic thresholding. For rapid adaptation, it employs few-shot learning using prototype-based classification, requiring only a handful of labeled samples. FARM also supports full retraining when enough drifted samples accumulate, updating the latent space for long-term integration. Experiments on the BenchMFC dataset demonstrate that FARM improves classification performance under covariate drift by 5.6\%, and achieves an average F1 score of 0.85 on unseen malware families using only few-shot adaptation, which further increases to 0.94 after retraining. These results highlight FARM's robustness and adaptability in dynamic malware detection environments under limited supervision.

> Prompt injection evaluations typically treat refusal as a stable, binary indicator of safety. This study challenges that paradigm by modeling refusal as a local decision boundary and examining its stability under structured perturbations. We evaluated two models, GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, using 3,274 perturbation runs derived from refusal-inducing prompt injection attempts. Each base prompt was subjected to 25 perturbations across five structured families, with outcomes manually coded as Refusal, Partial Compliance, or Full Compliance.   Using chi-square tests, logistic regression, mixed-effects modeling, and a novel Refusal Boundary Entropy (RBE) metric, we demonstrate that while both models refuse >94% of attempts, refusal instability is persistent and non-uniform. Approximately one-third of initial refusal-inducing prompts exhibited at least one "refusal escape," a transition to compliance under perturbation. We find that artifact type is a stronger predictor of refusal failure than perturbation style. Textual artifacts, such as ransomware notes, exhibited significantly higher instability, with flip rates exceeding 20%. Conversely, executable malware artifacts showed zero refusal escapes in both models. While GPT-4o demonstrated tighter refusal enforcement and lower RBE than GPT-4.1, it did not eliminate artifact-dependent risks. These findings suggest that single-prompt evaluations systematically overestimate safety robustness. We conclude that refusal behavior is a probabilistic, artifact-dependent boundary phenomenon rather than a stable binary property, requiring a shift in how LLM safety is measured and audited.

> The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in domains such as smart cities, transportation, and industrial systems has heightened the urgency of addressing their security vulnerabilities. IoT devices often operate under limited computational resources, lack robust physical safeguards, and are deployed in heterogeneous and dynamic networks, making them prime targets for cyberattacks and malware applications. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to automated malware detection and classification, but practical deployment requires models that are both effective and lightweight. The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of four supervised learning models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron) for malware detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. We evaluate model performance in both binary and multiclass classification tasks, assess sensitivity to training data volume, and analyze temporal robustness to simulate deployment in evolving threat landscapes. Our results show that tree-based models achieve high accuracy and generalization, even with limited training data, while performance deteriorates over time as malware diversity increases. These findings underscore the importance of adaptive, resource-efficient ML models for securing IoT systems in real-world environments.
